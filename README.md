# sign-up-form
This project was created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form). It involved creating a sign-up form for a fake service. A JavaScript check is performed on the password inputs to verify that the passwords match and that they are not empty. The effects of this check are only visual as the form is not actually submitted anywhere. The project serves as a brief demonstration of some CSS and JavaScript skills.
